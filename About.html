                      Sahithya Vidya Vachaspati Sahitya Vidyalankara Acharya Vijayanandanatha is the 
                      founder of Ravindra Bharathi Gurukula Vidyalaya at early 90's. Later he took the 
                      Studentship of Srimad Paramahamsa Parivrajaka Acharya Avadhuta 
                      Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Swamy who is the former Peetadhipathi of 
                      Sri Kanchi Peetam at Kaanchipuram.Guruji established many temples. 
                      One of the most powerful temple is Asta Dasha Bhuji Maha Lakshmi Temple,
                      located at Hasthinapuram, Hyderabad.which is derived from Saptashati Chandi 
                      where the godess chandi matha will be having 18 hands and 18 ayudhas. the meanings of 
                      these hands and ayudhas in saptashati are not only to kill the evil Sumba Nishumba 
                      but also the negative of our mind so that there will be positive Aura to our bodies.
