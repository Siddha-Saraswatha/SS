                  <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics male</h4>
                  Even if not much appreciated by others, a Bharani male only has good intentions in his heart for others and will never hurt someone consciously. The male has a general tendency to always listen to his conscience, which may backfire at times. It is in his nature to speak his mind and tell the truth, and that’s what people dislike about him. Although he tries to express his true feelings, he is often a target of misunderstanding. A Bharani male has a very forgiving heart, so if he is ever made upset, all one needs to do is apologise with sincerity, and he will forgive him in a heartbeat.
                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession male</h4>
                  One can never say what is the right or auspicious career option for a Bharani male. He is someone who can be trusted with any kind of job, be it arts, music, media, sports, or business. Although, a Bharani male should try and dabble in the business of tobacco, as he can see the most success in it. He can expect a positive shift in his situation after the age of 33. Though his career will thrive in any corner of the earth, following his profession on the eastern side of his home will be the best choice.                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility male</h4>
                  Family is the most important thing for the male born in Bharani Nakshatra, and he loves his family unconditionally. The extent of devotion to his family is sometimes the reason for ridicule by them, and unfortunately, a Bharani male misses out on his father’s love. His maternal uncles are usually the source of support for them, and his friends are always there for him. Bharani males usually get married around the age of 27 to 32 and are more apparent of having a male child.    <br>
                  <h4>Health male</h4>
                  A Bharani male is generally a very healthy person and is barely ever ill, even if he doesn’t take much care of himself. Although as he gets older, health issues like diabetes, malaria, apoplexy, or dental problems may occur. Bharani male is not foodie, and is more the kind who eats to survive.
                   <br>
                  <h4>Characteristics female</h4>
                  Although bold and outgoing in nature, females belonging to the Bharani Nakshatra are mostly very respectful to their parents and elders. They have a very pure personality and are very innocent. They have a natural charm to them; that makes people want to stay around them. What sets them aside from the rest is that even if they have a very modest character, they are usually very independent and like to follow their heart. One never has to worry about taking care of a Bharani female as they can do that themselves and won’t heed other people’s judgement.                  <br>
                  <h4>Profession female</h4>
                  As mentioned above, a Bharani female is an independent and career-driven person. She is the kind of person who sought out opportunities without waiting for them to arrive, which makes them a good businesswoman. Any job is suitable for them as they are very passionate about their career, but their charming nature makes them ideal for a sales job or a tourist guide. Sports is also a good field for them.                  <br>
                  <h4>Compatibility female</h4>
                  A Bharani female will be fortunate in finding a very loving and caring partner and is more probable of having a happy married life. There might arise some conflicts between her and her in-laws due to her headstrong nature, but they are not that big to be of concern. The female of this nakshatra is generally the dominant figure in the relationship but she will always have the trust and loyalty of her spouse.                  <br>
                  <h4> Health female</h4>
                  These females are more likely to have a generally healthy life and won’t have to be worried about health issues. But as time goes on, they might face problems such as menstrual or uterus issues. They should also be wary of tuberculosis as it might cause problems in the future.
